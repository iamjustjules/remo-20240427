Homework

- Objective Develop a Terraform setup that deploys identical resources across two different AWS regions using modular design principles. The resources include EC2 instances and DynamoDB tables.

Step 1 Understand the Project Structure modules

- Directory Contains reusable Terraform code for each type of resource.
- ec2_instance Module for creating an EC2 instance.
- dynamodb_table Module for creating a DynamoDB table.
- Regional Directories (us-east-1 and eu-west-1) Each contains configuration files that use the modules to deploy resources specific to that region.

Step 2 Create the Modules

- EC2 Instance Module This should define how to create an EC2 instance, including necessary variables like AMI ID, instance type, and instance name.
- DynamoDB Table Module This should outline the creation of a DynamoDB table with configurable parameters such as table name.

Step 3 Configure Each Region

- Each regional directory will have its own main.tf that calls the modules with parameters specific to that region, such as the AMI ID and table name.

Step 4 Define the Variables and Outputs

- Variables Each module should include variable definitions to accept inputs like AMI IDs and table names. You can also use terraform.tfvars if needed.
- Outputs After deploying the resources, outputs should be configured to return essential information like EC2 instance IDs and DynamoDB table names.
